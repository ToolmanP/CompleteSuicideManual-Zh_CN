# 活下去

## Stay Alive

如你所见，这个repo是从`完全自杀手册`那里fork而来的，如果所以如果你已经下定决心了的话，完全可以从左上角的那个小图标里点进去，那里有完整的中文版手册，整个手册写的很清晰，很能体现作者和译者下的功夫。当然既然你已经都有闲工夫来这里看看了，不妨坐下来歇一歇。 这个标题没有什么事实上的道德判断，毕竟我也没有办法阻止你做出你认为正确的事情。当你厌倦了你的生活的时候，你可能需要的是结束你的生活而非你的生命。请保重。

**生命只有一次，所以请不要后悔你的选择。**

As you can see, this repo is forked from the Chinese version of `Complete Suicide Manual` but overhauled from the ground up. So if you've decided to take your life, you can jump to that manual and figure yourself out. The manual is well-documented and it can be inferred that the author and the transcriber have both put a lot of effort into it. However, if you have already wasted your time reading my nonsense, why not take a rest? This title has no morale judgment, since after all I can not prevent you from doing the things you believe are correct. When you are fed up with your life, what you need to put to an end is not your living but your life. Take Care.

**Please make sure that, life can only happen once and don't regret your choice.**
